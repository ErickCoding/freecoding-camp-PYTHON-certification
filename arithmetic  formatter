#input for user to type
    #we can add error statements afterwards another section for this
# first looking at the example there is 4 line of text so itll require 4 prints
#the 1st line is all numbers from the first line and spaces
#the 2nd line is the operation and the 2nd number
#the 3rd line is a number of dashes based of the indexes of the formula
#the 4th line is the answer
# just looking at it i see that i should organize it into 5 list
    #split the input by the comma and make into individual formulas so input="x+x,y+y,..." becomes formulas=("x+x","y+y",...)
    #split the list of formulas into 3 list first num,operations and 2nd num im thinking list to an index ill do a loop to locate the operant index and split it into three list base of that index
    #in addition there may be issue with the input and spaces so i'll delete all spaces in the orignal input before
#so the first thing is determine the number of spaces needed for the first row so we are told there are 4 spaces in between each formula. and there most be a space between the operand  and the largest length number
    #str are just formulas since there no operation in the first row i would set space=" " so 2*space+(number with the larger index - first num index)+first num index number+4*space
    #to make the rows add up do a loop and row=row+2*space+(number with the larger index - index of first num)+smaller index number+4*space
        #to find the max length between the two numbers just do an if then statement
#2nd row will be same concept but since there is an operation symbol there so formula is so operation+space+(number with the larger index - first num index)+first num index number+4*space loop
#3rd row will be even easier  met a variable dash="-" dash*(len of formula)+4*space then loop
#input to ask if the user wants the answers
    #i would set variables to set each line equal so that it'll be if yes print=firstrow print+2ndrow,etc
#4th row answer is the answer make a new list for answer= eval then str it
    #same concept as before do space*(len of formula-len of answer)+answer loop it

#way to add division is to limit the decimal place by using float and limit the decimal
#if we use multiplication we can do if statement during the for loop so large numbers would be transformed to "number*E"  so it takes less space
